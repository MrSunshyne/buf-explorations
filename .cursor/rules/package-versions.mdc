# Package Version Requirements

This rule specifies the exact versions of packages that should be used in the project to ensure compatibility between Connect, Buf, and TypeScript.

## Required Versions

The following package versions must be used:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@connectrpc/connect": "^2.0.2",
    "@connectrpc/connect-web": "^2.0.2",
    "@bufbuild/protobuf": "^2.2.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@bufbuild/protoc-gen-es": "^2.2.5",
    "@connectrpc/protoc-gen-connect-es": "^1.6.1"
  }
}
```

## Version Compatibility

These versions are specifically chosen to work together:
- Connect packages (connect and connect-web) must be at version 2.0.2
- Buf packages (protobuf and protoc-gen-es) must be at version 2.2.5
- The Connect ES generator must be at version 1.6.1

## Installation

When installing dependencies, always use:
```bash
pnpm install
```

This will ensure the correct versions are installed based on the package.json specifications.

# Test Execution Guidelines

This rule specifies how to run tests to verify CRUD operations in the project.

## Running Tests

The tests package uses Vitest for testing. There are several ways to run the tests:

1. Run all tests once:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter tests test
   ```

2. Run tests in watch mode (useful during development):
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter tests test:watch
   ```

3. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter tests test:coverage
   ```

## Test Structure

- Tests are located in the `tests/src` directory
- Each test file should focus on a specific CRUD operation or feature
- Tests should be independent and not rely on the state of other tests

## Best Practices

1. Always run tests before committing changes
2. Use watch mode during development for faster feedback
3. Run coverage tests before merging to ensure adequate test coverage
4. Make sure the server is running before executing tests

## Common Issues

If tests fail:
1. Ensure the server is running and accessible
2. Check that all required environment variables are set
3. Verify that the test database is in a clean state
4. Check the test logs for specific error messages

## Example Test Run

```bash
# Start the server (in a separate terminal)
pnpm --filter server dev

# Run tests
pnpm --filter tests test
```
